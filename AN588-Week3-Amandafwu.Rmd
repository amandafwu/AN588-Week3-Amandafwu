```{r Challenge 1}
library(curl)
f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN588_Fall23/Country-Data-2016.csv") #curl function is similar to url 
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE) #read.csv reads a file in table format and creates a data frame 
head(d) #loads first 6 lines of the dataset
summary(d)
names(d)
#What are the median area and population size of all countries in the dataset?
attach(d, pos = 3, name = "area") #used attach() to make variables within the dataset so median can be taken from a particular column; pos = 3 means column 3 of the dataset 
median(area, na.rm = TRUE,) #added na.rm = TRUE from the module 
attach(d, pos = 2, name = "population") #used same pattern for population 
median(population, na.rm = TRUE)

#Create a new pop_density variable in your data frame. What are the 10 most dense countries? The 10 least dense?
d$density <- d$population/d$area
d <- d[order(-d$density), ]
d[1:10, ]
d <- d[order(d$density), ]
d[1:10, ]
# 10 most dense countries: Macau, Monaco, Holy See, Singapore, Hong Kong, Gibraltar, Bahrain, Maldives, Malta, Bermuda 
# 10 least dense countries: South Georgia, Greenland, Falkland Islands, Pitcairn Islands, Mongolia, Western Sahara, French Guiana, Namibia, Australia, Iceland 

#Extract data from the 20 largest countries into a new variable. What are the median area and population size of these countries?
e <- attach(d, pos = 2, name = "population")
v <- e[1:20]

###CANT GET THIS TO WORK !!!!!!!!!!!

#Extract data from all countries beginning with the letters “A” through “F”. What are the mean area and population size of these countries?
new <- d[grep("^[A-F]", d$country), ] 
summary(new)
mean(new$population, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(new$area, na.rm = TRUE)
```


```{r Challenge 2}
#code given from the module
par(mfrow = c(2, 3))
boxplot(d$population)
boxplot(log(d$population))
boxplot(d$area)
boxplot(log(d$area))
barplot(d$population)
barplot(d$area)
```


```{r Challenge 3}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))  # gives us two panels
attach(d)
hist(log(population), freq = FALSE, col = "red", main = "Plot 1", xlab = "log(population size)",
    ylab = "density", ylim = c(0, 0.2))

    ylab = "density", ylim = c(0, 0.2))

par(mfrow = c(1, 1))  # set up one panel and redraw the log(population) histogram

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
