# Module 6 Challenges
## Challenge 1
```{r Challenge 1}
library(curl)
f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN588_Fall23/Country-Data-2016.csv") #curl function is similar to url 
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)#read.csv reads a file in table format and creates a data frame 
head(d) #loads first 6 lines of the dataset
summary(d) #offers quick overview of the columns
names(d) #offers names of the columns

#What are the median area and population size of all countries in the dataset?
attach(d, pos = 3, name = "area") #used attach() to make variables within the dataset so median can be taken from a particular column; pos = 3 means column 3 of the dataset 
median(area, na.rm = TRUE,) #added na.rm = TRUE from the module 
attach(d, pos = 2, name = "population") #used same pattern for population 
median(population, na.rm = TRUE)
detach(area) #module said we had to detach after we attach when finished with the function

#Create a new pop_density variable in your data frame. What are the 10 most dense countries? The 10 least dense?
d$density <- d$population/d$area #made a new pop_density variable
d <- d[order(-d$density), ]
d[1:10, ]
d <- d[order(d$density), ]
d[1:10, ]
# 10 most dense countries: Macau, Monaco, Holy See, Singapore, Hong Kong, Gibraltar, Bahrain, Maldives, Malta, Bermuda 
# 10 least dense countries: South Georgia, Greenland, Falkland Islands, Pitcairn Islands, Mongolia, Western Sahara, French Guiana, Namibia, Australia, Iceland 

#Extract data from the 20 largest countries into a new variable. What are the median area and population size of these countries?
largest <- head(d[order(-d$area), ], 20) #head gets the first rows, order puts it in descending order
largest
names(largest) #shows the names/positions of each column for attach
attach(largest, pos = 3, name = "area" ) #same process as before
median(area, na.rm = TRUE)
detach(area)
attach(largest, pos = 2, name = "population" )
median(population, na.rm = TRUE)
detach(population)


#Extract data from all countries beginning with the letters “A” through “F”. What are the mean area and population size of these countries?
new <- d[grep("^[A-F]", d$country), ]  #grep: used to take out patterns within a column? 
summary(new)
mean(new$population, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(new$area, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Challenge 2
```{r Challenge 2}
#The barplot() function is useful for crude data, with bar height proportional to the value of the variable. The function dotchart() provides a similar graphical summary.
#code given from the module
par(mfrow = c(2, 3))
#par() sets up a grid of panels for you to plot
boxplot(d$population)
boxplot(log(d$population))
#adding log() transforms it into a box & whiskers graph?
boxplot(d$area)
boxplot(log(d$area))
barplot(d$population)
barplot(d$area)
```

## Challenge 3
```{r Challenge 3}
#hist() function returns a histogram showing the complete empirical distribution of the data in binned categories, which is useful for checking skewwness of the data, symmetry, multi-modality, etc.
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))  #gives two panels
attach(d)
hist(log(population), freq = FALSE, col = "red", main = "Plot 1", xlab = "log(population size)",
    ylab = "density", ylim = c(0, 0.2))
#vs
hist(log(population), freq = TRUE, col = "red", main = "Plot 1", xlab = "log(population size)",
    ylab = "density", ylim = c(0, 0.2)) 
#freq = FALSE scaled the y axis so you can see the proportions while freq = TRUE does not scale so it looked like a bunch of full bars with no difference
hist(log(area), freq = TRUE, col = "red", main = "Plot 2", xlab = "log(area)",
    ylab = "density", ylim = c(0, 0.2))

par(mfrow = c(1, 1))  # set up one panel and redraw the log(population) histogram
hist(log(population), freq = TRUE, col = "white", main = "My Plot with Mean and Density",
    xlab = "log(population size)", ylab = "density", ylim = c(0, 0.2))
abline(v = mean(log(population), na.rm = TRUE), col = "blue") #code gives an error but will knit fine?
lines(density(log(population), na.rm = TRUE), col = "green")
detach(d)
```


## Challenge 4
```{r Challenge 4}
#What is the most common form of government in the Country-Data-2016 dataset. How many countries have that form?
sort(table(d$govt_form), decreasing = TRUE)
#sort(): similar to order() for vectors
#table(): summarize counts and proportions for categorical variables in your dataset
#Answer: Republic is the most common form of government with 127 countries following under this form of government
```


## Challenge 5

Which has a larger average female body mass? Which is more sexually dimorphic?

#Compare the body size of my two main study taxa at the Family level (i.e., Cercopithecidae vs. Atelidae) by plotting (using {ggplot2}) the body mass of males and females and sexual dimorphism. If you can, make the Cercopithecid boxes green, and the Atelid boxes purple.
